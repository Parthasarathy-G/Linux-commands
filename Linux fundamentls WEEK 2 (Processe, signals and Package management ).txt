Getting Started with Linux Fundamentals: My Journey So Far

Over the past week, I decided to dive into the world of Linux and get a solid grasp of its fundamentals. I’ve always heard how crucial Linux is in the tech world, and I figured it was time to roll up my sleeves and get hands-on with it. Here’s what I’ve learnt so far:

Basic Commands

Learning the basic commands was my first step. These are essential for navigating and managing files and directories in Linux. Some of the commands I’ve explored include:

cd: To change directories. This is your go-to for moving around the file system.

whoami: A quick way to check which user is currently logged in.

clearTo clean up the clutter on your terminal.

pwd: Prints the current working directory, so you always know where you are.

touch: Creates new files effortlessly.

mkdir and rmdir: To create and remove directories, respectively.

rm: Deletes files, but you need to be cautious with this one!

cp and mv: For copying and moving files or renaming them.

nano and vi: Text editors to create and edit files directly from the terminal.

ls: Lists files in the current directory, with variations like ls -a for hidden files and ls -l for detailed information.

File Viewing and Searching
Viewing and searching files effectively is another key aspect of Linux. Here are some useful commands I’ve picked up:

cat, more, and less: These help view file contents, each with slightly different functionality.

head and tail: Display the first or last few lines of a file, with options to specify the number of lines.

nl: Shows file contents with line numbers.

find and locate: For searching files and directories. find offers advanced options like filtering by modification time, while locate is faster but relies on an updated database.

which, man, and whereis: Help locate executable files and view their documentation.
