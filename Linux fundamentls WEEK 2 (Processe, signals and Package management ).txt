Getting Started with Linux Fundamentals: My Journey So Far

Over the past week, I decided to dive into the world of Linux and get a solid grasp of its fundamentals. I’ve always heard how crucial Linux is in the tech world, and I figured it was time to roll up my sleeves and get hands-on with it. Here’s what I’ve learnt so far:



Basic Commands

Learning the basic commands was my first step. These are essential for navigating and managing files and directories in Linux. Some of the commands I’ve explored include:

cd: To change directories. This is your go-to for moving around the file system.

whoami: A quick way to check which user is currently logged in.

clearTo clean up the clutter on your terminal.

pwd: Prints the current working directory, so you always know where you are.

touch: Creates new files effortlessly.

mkdir and rmdir: To create and remove directories, respectively.

rm: Deletes files, but you need to be cautious with this one!

cp and mv: For copying and moving files or renaming them.

nano and vi: Text editors to create and edit files directly from the terminal.

ls: Lists files in the current directory, with variations like ls -a for hidden files and ls -l for detailed information.



File Viewing and Searching

Viewing and searching files effectively is another key aspect of Linux. Here are some useful commands I’ve picked up:

cat, more, and less: These help view file contents, each with slightly different functionality.

head and tail: Display the first or last few lines of a file, with options to specify the number of lines.

nl: Shows file contents with line numbers.

find and locate: For searching files and directories. find offers advanced options like filtering by modification time, while locate is faster but relies on an updated database.

which, man, and whereis: Help locate executable files and view their documentation.



File and User Permissions

Permissions are at the heart of Linux’s security. Understanding and managing these permissions was both challenging and rewarding. Here’s what I learnt:

File permissions are categorised for owners, groups, and others. You can read (r), write (w), or execute (x) based on these permissions.

Commands like chmod allow you to modify these permissions easily. For example, chmod u-r <filename> removes read access for the user.

Ownership can be changed with chown, and groups can also be set using the same command.
