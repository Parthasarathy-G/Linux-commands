Linux Process Management

Learning how to manage processes in Linux was both fascinating and a bit challenging. Commands like ps, top, and kill gave me a new perspective on how operating systems handle applications and processes in real-time. For example, understanding the difference between ps aux and top took some trial and error, especially while figuring out which processes belonged to which users.
One specific problem I encountered was with kill commands. Initially, I tried to terminate a process by name using pkill, but it didn’t work as expected because I didn’t specify the exact process name. This led me to dive deeper into filtering processes with ps and understanding the PID system.


Linux Package Management

Working with apt commands taught me the importance of keeping software updated while avoiding unnecessary installations. Commands like sudo apt update, sudo apt upgrade, and sudo apt autoremove showed me how to maintain a clean and efficient system. At first, I accidentally removed a package along with its configuration files using sudo apt purge, which broke a dependency for another tool I was using. This mistake highlighted the importance of understanding the impact of each command before execution.




Networking Concepts


IP Addressing

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other.
Subnetting

Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks. It helps in efficient IP address management and improves network performance.
MAC Address

A MAC address is a hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces. It is used for communication within a local network segment.
DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

DHCP is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.
TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is a set of protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It includes layers such as the application, transport, internet, and network access layers.
OSI Model

The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application.
Routing

Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic. Routers are devices that forward data packets between networks.
Switches and Hubs

Switches and hubs are networking devices used to connect multiple devices on a local network. Switches operate at the data link layer, while hubs operate at the physical layer.
Firewalls

Firewalls are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They help protect networks from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
